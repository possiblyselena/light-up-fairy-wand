# June 23rd: Schematic
For this project, I'm making a pcb with 5 LEDs (one for each prong) for my wand! Originally I wanted to add an accerleometer as well so I could control the LEDs, but first I wanted to design a simple one before I get into researching on how I'd excecute that.

It's getting late so I only got to finish the schematic since I needed to know what footprints to use.

**Total Time Spent: 1 hour**
