# June 23rd: Schematic
For this project, I'm making a pcb with 5 LEDs (one for each prong) for my wand! Originally I wanted to add an accerleometer as well so I could control the LEDs, but first I wanted to design a simple one before I get into researching on how I'd excecute that.

It's getting late so I only got to finish the schematic since I needed to know what footprints to use.

**Total Time Spent: 1 hour**

# June 24th: PCB
I finished designing the PCB and routing took up the most time because I suck at placing my components efficiently. I am actually not going to be placing my switch and my button on the PCB, but I'm going to be soldering wires that connect it to the base of my wand.
